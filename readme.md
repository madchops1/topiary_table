# Getting Started
Begin by running `npm install` and `bower install` to update
node and frontend dependencies and make sure everything is working.

Also make sure you have the grunt client installed.

Then just run `grunt` to preprocess css and serve the site locally.

To process the site for distribution run grunt copy:dist after running and stopping a grunt cycle.
